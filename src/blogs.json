    "summary": "Apple's iPhone and Samsung's Galaxy S line are classic rivals, but when it comes to super-premium, super-expensive phones, you also have to consider Samsung's Galaxy Note.",
    "description": "The latest is the Galaxy Note 10, which comes in multiple flavours for the first time. The standard Note 10 doesn't go quite as high-end, but sees a small price cut as a result, while the top-end Galaxy Note 10+ goes big throughout… seriously big, considering that 6.8in screen. <br/> <br/> Apple's iPhone XS is still its mainline smartphone as of this writing, although we are seemingly on the verge of an iPhone 11 announcement in a matter of weeks. But if you're considering spending big money on a high-end handset right now, here's how the battle between the iPhone XS and Galaxy Note 10 looks now that we've been hands-on with the Note 10.",

    "description": "Google's Android and Apple's iOS are operating systems used primarily in mobile technology, such as smartphones and tablets. Android, which is Linux-based and partly open source, is more PC-like than iOS, in that its interface and basic features are generally more customizable from top to bottom. However, iOS' uniform design elements are sometimes seen as being more user-friendly. <br/><br/> You should choose your smartphone and tablet systems carefully, as switching from iOS to Android or vice versa will require you to buy apps again in the Google Play or Apple App Store. Android is now the world’s most commonly used smartphone platform and is used by many different phone manufacturers. iOS is only used on Apple devices, such as the iPhone. <br/> <h1>Interface</h1> <br/> iOS and Android both use touch interfaces that have a lot in common - swiping, tapping and pinch-and-zoom. Both operating systems boot to a homescreen, which is similar to a computer desktop. While an iOS home screen only contains rows of app icons, Android allows the use of widgets, which display auto-updating information such as weather and email. The iOS user interface features a dock where users can pin their most frequently used applications. A status bar runs across the top on both iOS and Android, offering information such the time, WiFi or cell signal, and battery life; on Android the status bar also shows the number of newly received emails, messages and reminders.",
