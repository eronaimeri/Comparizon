                <h5>The Great Smartphone War</h5>

                <h5>Date May 03, 2014</h5>

                <p>For three years, Apple and Samsung have clashed on a scale almost unprecedented in business history, their legal war costing more than a billion dollars and spanning four continents.
                <br /><br />
                Australians bought 1 million fewer smartphones last year than in 2014, as higher prices, market saturation and an off year for Apple's iPhone saw Google's Android operating system retain its local dominance.
                <br /><br />
                The annual Australian Smartphone and Wearables Devices Market Study from research firm Telsyte also found sales of smart watches – led by the Apple Watch – remained sluggish, but the adoption of fitness-related wearable technology was taking off.</p>
