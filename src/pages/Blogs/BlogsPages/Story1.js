                <h5>Samsung Galaxy Note 10 vs Apple iPhone XS: The weigh-in</h5>

                <p>Apple's iPhone and Samsung's Galaxy S line are classic rivals, but when it comes to super-premium, super-expensive phones, you also have to consider Samsung's Galaxy Note.
                <br /><br />
                The latest is the Galaxy Note 10, which comes in multiple flavours for the first time. The standard Note 10 doesn't go quite as high-end, but sees a small price cut as a result, while the top-end Galaxy Note 10+ goes big throughoutâ€¦ seriously big, considering that 6.8in screen.
                <br /><br />
                Apple's iPhone XS is still its mainline smartphone as of this writing, although we are seemingly on the verge of an iPhone 11 announcement in a matter of weeks. But if you're considering spending big money on a high-end handset right now, here's how the battle between the iPhone XS and Galaxy Note 10 looks now that we've been hands-on with the Note 10.</p>
