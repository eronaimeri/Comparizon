                Apple and Samsung are set to face - off in Australia in a clash of smartphone launches, which is likely to hike prices.But there’s a way to avoid paying more.
                TWO technology giants will go head-to-head in Australia next Friday in an unprecedented clash of smartphone launches.
                In one corner, the world’s richest technology company will launch two updates to its most popular handsets, the iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus.
                In the other corner, the world’s biggest smartphone maker will release its most expensive handset yet, the Samsung Galaxy Note 8.
                <br /><br />
                But this Apple versus Samsung battle is not as clear cut as you might expect, as Note users are likely to be haunted by last year’s handset fires, and Apple is rolling the dice to discover how many of its users will opt for modestly updated handsets rather than its most advanced and most expensive iPhone yet.
                Regardless of which firm wins the war, industry experts predict it will force up the price of smartphones for all buyers, and convince more Australians to upgrade the device in their pockets.</p>
